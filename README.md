🐍 Python Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Examples
This repository contains simple and clear Python examples to help understand key concepts in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) such as classes, objects, constructors, inheritance, and operator overloading.

📁 Files Included
1. classes_and_objects.py
Demonstrates how to define a class (dog), create objects, and use methods.

Uses class and instance attributes.

2. Constructors.py
Focuses on the __init__ constructor to initialize object attributes.

3. inheritancess.py
Demonstrates single inheritance with a base class animal and derived classes dog and cat.

Shows method overriding using speak() method.

4. opearator_overloading.py
Covers operator overloading using the __add__() method (assumed based on filename).

Allows custom behavior when using + between objects.

(Please refer to the actual file content for specific implementation.)

🎯 Learning Objectives
Understand how to define and use classes and objects in Python.

Learn how constructors work to initialize object state.

Explore inheritance and polymorphism through method overriding.

Get introduced to operator overloading for customizing built-in operations.

🛠 Requirements
Python 3.x

No additional libraries required.
